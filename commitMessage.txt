version 1.0.0
functionalities:
1. be able to save and show todo
2. be able to delete a todo

note:
TodoApp.js imports TodoInput.js and TodoList.js to make the view,
while TodoApp2.js integrate them within itself. Becase TodoApp2.js is ahead of TodoApp.js,therefore, I am going to seperate the TodoApp2.js later.
